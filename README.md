# task-6
I have successfully analyzed monthly revenue and order volume using Python and SQL adapting the dataset to match the available columns. First I loaded the dataset online sales csv and converted InvoiceDate into a datetime format for accurate time based grouping. Then I computed total revenue by multiplying UnitPrice and Quantity. Using SQLite I structured a query that extracted year month revenue order volume and StockCode grouping results by time and product identifiers. After executing the query I stored the output in a pandas DataFrame ensuring a well organized results table. My approach not only aligned with SQL best practices but also maintained clarity for further visualization or deeper trend analysis.
